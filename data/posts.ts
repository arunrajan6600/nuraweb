Then the words corresponding to the positional values from video is selected and superimposed over the video. The fundamental intention of this experiment is to explore how language, pixels, vectors are all interconnected in a world of pseudo-futurism which might transformed to a \"future\". \n*Italic text*Video Credits: Rajesh Karthy, Dr. Jaseera Majid"
