When the audience becomes part of the piece, where does the artwork truly begin and end?\n\n## The Participatory Nature of Modern Art\n\nInteractive installations challenge the traditional notion of art as a static, completed object. Instead, they exist in a state of perpetual becoming, shaped by each participant's engagement."

This technological mediation doesn't distance us from the artâ€”rather, it creates new possibilities for connection and meaning-making."
