These contributions create an ever-evolving tapestry of collective memory, blurring the lines between individual and shared experiences.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe project raises questions about:\n\n- The reliability of digital archives\n- The nature of memory in the digital age\n- The role of AI in preserving and reconstructing memories\n- The future of personal and collective remembrance"
